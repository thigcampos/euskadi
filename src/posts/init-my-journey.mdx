Up until the age of 12 or 13, my primary aspiration was to become a football player (soccer, for Americans). However, an injury sidelined me for a while, and during that time, I began to realize that pursuing a career in football might be impossible. Simultaneously, my interest in physics and algebra blossomed as I started watching TV shows like The Big Bang Theory and Silicon Valley. Although I struggled with geometry, becoming an engineer like my father became my top priority.

Around this period, my friends and I spent a lot of time playing vintage Pokémon games on a GBA emulator and discussing scientific articles, always skipping the math because we couldn't understand. Technology was a recurring topic in our conversations, and after some research, we decided to explore building a robot. However, to achieve this goal, we needed to learn a programming language, such as C. So, I began searching for a suitable course and discovered that the Universidade de São Paulo offered a PDF guide covering the fundamentals of C programming.

About two weeks after I began learning C programming, my algebra teacher assigned my class an extensive list of quadratic formula exercises. I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about tackling them. However, this assignment inspired me to create my first-ever software – a quadratic formula solver. It took me a couple of hours, but I managed to create it.
