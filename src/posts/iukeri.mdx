The concept of Iukeri came from my desire to own a unique space on the web — 
one that goes beyond being just a portfolio instead aims to be the core for 
all my future applications. By naming the project after the region I was born, 
I seek to create a sense of fusion of my personal heritage and my digital 
ambitition.

Gathering Iukeri's requirements seems to be way easier than planning how to 
apply all of them. The comprehensive list of requirements includes a low cost 
of maintenance, a blog with Markdown support, privacy-oriented data management, 
easy customizability and expandability, strict adherence to accessibility rules, 
and the capacity to run all kinds of media, including photos, videos, and audios.
During the initial iterations, I sketched freely, exploring various interests. 
However, this approach proved to be less than optimal; each new reference triggered 
a new iteration, leading to a consistent change in the project.

After a hiatus of several months, I resumed the project with the goal of refining 
Iukeri's requirements and documentation. The knowledge acquired in recent college 
classes, such as Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction, was essential 
in improving the gathering and definition of requirements and structuring the project.
This time, design iterations were more concise and complementary. A refined requirements 
list, coupled with an extensive collection of references in various media types, facilitated 
the conceptualization of a global vision for Iukeri. New references didn't have the same 
significant impact as before.

As part of my desire to craft a personal digital oasis, including references to some of 
my top interests was definitely a priority. Each passion had a distinct level of influence 
on the project's design. The following references are worth mentioning: the architecture of 
Barcelona and Nice; songs by João Gilberto, Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes; movies by Wes 
Anderson and Godard; and visual diaries by Julia Belinatti and Daniel Simmons.

In a few days, I had defined the typography and color scheme, and numerous screens were 
prototyped, including both web and mobile versions. It's worth mentioning that the design 
underwent a few alterations during development — either to improve loading speed or to 
enhance visibility and accessibility.
