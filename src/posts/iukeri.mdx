title: A glimpse of me
date: '2023-09-08'
summary: After years, I finally have my own website. The development of Iukeri can be summed up as a never-ending project that has gone through many redesigns.

The conception of Iukeri arises from my aspiration for a personal space on the web, 
something very common in the early days of the web 2.0 era. The project goes beyond 
being just a portfolio site; it seeks, in various ways, to represent my persona, a 
goal that inspired the project's name itself. The website was named in homage 
to the region where I was born, known as Juqueri, a word that originates from the 
ancient Tupi language îukeri and refers to plants of the Mimosa genus.

**Design**

Since the inception, the Iukeri project has proven to be challenging, presenting a 
set of requirements that were not straightforward to fulfil. Among these requirements 
were a low maintenance cost, inclusion of an easily manageable blog, absence of visitor 
data collection, ease of expansion and customisation, strict adherence to all best 
practices of accessibility, and the ability to reproduce a wide range of media, 
including photos, videos, and audio. Ideally, the site should reflect my tastes 
and interests, allowing for expansion to include new topics and easy maintenance.

The initial iterations of the website were conducted freely, exploring different personal 
tastes for web design. This approach proved fragile, as any new reference drastically 
altered the course of the project. After a few months of inactivity, I resumed the 
project with the mission to structure it more appropriately. The knowledge gained in 
recent semesters in subjects like Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction 
was crucial for gathering requirements and other tasks related to the initial structure 
of the project. This time, design iterations were much more concise and complementary. 
With reasonably well-defined requirements and a substantial collection of references in 
different media (audio, image, text, and video), forming a globalised vision of the project 
became easier. Now, new references no longer had a significant impact on the project's direction.
\
\
Among the sought references, I must list: Bossa Nova, my favourite music genre (listen to some 
of my favourite songs in the Bossa e Café playlist), football, my favourite sport and unconditional 
passion since childhood, highlighting Sport Club Corinthians Paulista and the Brazilian National Team, 
Linux and the Open-Source community, significant inspirations for my career as a software developer, 
the Week of 1922, the event that defined the course of Brazilian modernism in various arts, and 
London Diaries, a video series by Daniel Simmons.

In a matter of days, I was able to define the website's typography and colour schemes, as well as a 
considerable number of prototyped screens for both web and mobile. It's worth noting that the design 
underwent changes during the website development, either to expedite the process or to enhance the 
visibility and accessibility of the website.
