Here we go again...
\
\
I've tried to run a personal blog several times, but none of the platforms I tried suited my needs. 
Medium and LinkedIn were too focused on the professional side of blogging, and Blogger is owned by Google, 
which is a terrible feature for someone who cares about privacy. 
A few months ago I started to design my own website that would include a blog, 
in the initial setup it would include a Ghost instance, but then were replaced by Papyrus, 
a simple blog backend built with FastAPI by a colleague.
\
\
So what happened to my site? It's now paused. The project has some dependencies, including Papyrus and Ionique, 
both of which are currently very immature at the moment and under heavy development, which may include some breaking changes. \
There's also the financial side, it could end up being an expensive experiment and I'm not willing to pay for it now.
\
\
In this scenario, I came across BearBlog, a text-oriented and open-source blogging platform, and here I am. 
I hope to post weekly about computing, software development, self-hosting and other important topics in my life.
\
\
Thanks for reading so far.
