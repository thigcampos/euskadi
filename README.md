## Thiago Campos
My personal website was built using [Zola](https://getzola.com) and styled in [SASS](https://sass.org).

## Ambitions
From a philosophical point of view, the website aims to be a platform for exhibiting all my creative 
productions on the web, just as an art gallery serves to exhibit the works of a visual artist. On the 
technical side, the website's ambition is to be a [Hypermedia-Driven Application](https://hypermedia.systems/book/contents/)
in its entirety, as well as to meet the [WCAG 3.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/) in 
order to deliver a complete experience for all possible users and, last but not least, in a near future,
to fully implement the [Ionique web-component library](https://github.com/thigcampos/ionique).
