Salut, Je suis Thiago Campos

A software engineer and design enthusiast, living in the beautiful landscapes of Mantiqueira, Brazil. My interests lead me to believe that being at the intersection of technology and the humanities gives my projects a purpose that transcends technology as a mere end in itself.
